You've optimised everything. Your app responds in a few milliseconds, but users still see slow pages. Your web app's client side component runs in the user's browser with performance characteristics that you have little control over. This talk will cover a few rules to improve end-user perceived performance of a web application. We'll look at tunable parameters, ways to optimise front end code, and how to find out what needs fixing with YSLow.

This talk is aimed at web developers interested in building fast user interfaces.  Attendees will need to be familiar with HTTP and web development.
